     <h1>NASA organization and staff level</h1>
     <p>NASA’s organization includes nine eld centers: Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center,
Glenn Research Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center, Kennedy
Space Center, Langley Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, and Stennis
Space Center. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is not a NASA eld center, 
but is instead a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), 
although it is commonly referred to as a NASA eld center. NASA also operates several 
other facilities such as the Wallops Flight Facility, which is managed by Goddard Space
Flight Center and used as a launch site for small satellites, sounding rockets and some
air vehicles.</p>
<p> NASA also operates the Michoud Assembly Facility, which is managed
by Marshall Space Flight Center and has the ability to manufacture and test large
scale rocket engines and their components. The location of the centers is  shown in 
figure.NASA, like many government agencies, augments its civil servant workforce with 
contractors, both for direct support and to provide the equipment and capabilities that
the agency procures, such as launch vehicles and spacecraft. All of the NASA centers
have long and varied histories; the oldest, Langley Research Center, will celebrate
its centennial in 2017. The capabilities of some centers overlap, to some degree,
with other centers, but differences in staff expertise, facility capabilities,
history, mission, culture, and current issues and challenges make it difficult 
to address some management issues with a one-size-ts-all approach. </p>
