<p>Aeronautics research is the foundation on which NASA was built, having been created out of the aeronautics 
research facilities of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.7 Four of the ten NASA 
centers were founded as part of these NACA facilities, and although a number of legacy facilities such as large
 subsonic wind tunnels have been “mothballed” or even dismantled over the years, 
many of the NASA aeronautics facilities are utilized regularly by other government agencies such as DOD,
 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and NOAA. The federal government’s longstanding interest in aeronautics
  research is justiwed by the direct and indirect impacts that aeronautics has on the U.S. economy through 
  the development of safe and efwcient civil and military air vehicles. </p>
  <p>NASA aeronautics research has
   included focused investigations in many different disciplines (e.g., aerodynamics, propulsion, materials and structures, avionics, and xight dynamics and controls) directed at many different applications (e.g., efwcient subsonic wxed-wing aircraft, high-speed civil transport systems, rotary wing aircraft, and even hypersonic airbreathing engines for multiple-stage-to-orbit space access). 
During the past 6 years, the key priorities and goals for NASA aeronautics research have included
increased aviation system capacity, improved aircraft safety and reliability, increased vehicle 
efwciency and performance, reduced energy consumption and environmental impact, utilization of
synergies with national defense and homeland security, and support for the space program. An 
example of NASA research aircraft for developing new fuel efwciency technologies is shown in
