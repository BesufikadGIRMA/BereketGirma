     <h1>NASA supports commercial space activity</h1> 
<p>Since the late 1950s, the U.S. government has been involved extensively in setting requirements, 
designing, testing, developing, and launching human and robotic spacecraft. NASA’s 
Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, initiated in 2006, is designed to 
foster development of privately operated space transportation systems for access to the ISS
. This program, which is currently in Phase 2, is a public-private partnership, in that both 
NASA and the participating contractors contribute to the cost of developing new systems.
Currently, both SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corporation are under contract to develop new
launch vehicles and spacecraft, and on May 25, 2012, and again on October 9, 2012,
a Dragon capsule (without a crew) successfully berthed with the ISS. (See Figure below.) 
In addition, some</p>

<p>private companies, such as Virgin Galactic, are developing relatively low- cost, suborbital space transportation
systems on their own, with the expectation that space tourism by individuals will become a viable
business model. To date, more than 500 individuals have made deposits of $20,000 to $200,000 with
Virgin Galactic toward a future xight on a Virgin Galactic spacecraft (still under development).
Now that NASA has adopted an initiative to develop commercial capabilities with private
companies who are entering the business of developing testing and operating space systems. 
The government no longer has an exclusive role in the design, development, testing, evaluation
, and operations of human spacecraft systems.</p>

<p> new approach to procuring transportation services is an extension of U.S
government policy that discourages direct government competition with industry in manufacturing
systems or providing services that are available in the private marketplace. Of course, this 
approach is possible only because of previous investments by NASA and DOD over many decades in
the development of launch vehicles, systems, processes, technologies, and components. Just as 
many ongoing improvements in commercial spacecraft are enabled by NASA’s ongoing development of

advanced technologies for future civil space missions, the growth of a U.S. commercial space 
transportation sector would be greatly facilitated by continued investments by NASA in space 
transportation technology. The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 directs NASA to 
preserve the role of the United States as a leader in aeronautical and space science and 
technology.</p> 
<p> as a major consumer of space transportation services, it is in NASA’s interest
to promote advances in space transportation technologies, systems, and capabilities.
NASA research is particularly important for precompetitive technologies that are at
such a low level of 
maturity and/or have such a high level of risk that industry cannot justify developing these 
technologies using private capital.
