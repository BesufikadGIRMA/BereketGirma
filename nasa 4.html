<p>NASA astrophysics missions allow modern scientiwc explorers to search over unimaginable distances:
the closest star (other than the Sun) is more than 20 trillion miles away, and the distance
to the closest galaxy (other than our home galaxy) is thousands of times farther away. 
Astronomical instruments look across space and back in time: the Hubble Space Telescope, 
which can make observations free of the distorting effects of Earth’s atmosphere, 
has observed the most distant object seen, more than 13 billion light-years away, just as it
appeared 13 billion years ago. The Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope
), and other current and future missions will allow scientists to continue to explore in
greater depth the most basic questions of human destiny. However, current budget prioritie
s of the administration have led to delays—probably to the end of the decade—before a new pr
ogram could be developed to pursue the most recent decadal survey priority in dark energy s
cience, exoplanet science, and an understanding of the cosmos.
