<h1>THE purpse of the weabsite</h1>
<p>this website is designd to give infirmation to anybody who wants to get information about NASA.this website give
  information about the historical devlopment of NASA,the organization and staff level of NASA and the primery program area of NASA,
that are supported by differnt images.</p>




  <H2>The historical devlopment of NASA</H2>
  <P> The focus of NASA on aeronautics and space dates back to its founding, when the National
Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 transformed the NACA into NASA. The act speciwed 
that NASA shall plan, direct, and conduct aeronautical and space activities to increase 
scientiwc knowledge; support the development of advanced aircraft; develop and operate advanced
spacecraft; consult with the Department of Defense (DOD) and other federal agencies regarding 
matters of mutual interest; strongly encourage commercial activities in space; and ensure that the
United States remains a leader in aeronautics and space. For example, the first launch of a NASA
spacecraft is shown in Figure below. The act has been modiwed by Congress many times over 
the years, often upon presidential recommendation. This section describes some of the key changes.</P>

<p>In 1973 the provisions for the National Aeronautics and Space Council, which was set up in
1958 to coordinate among the nation’s space and aeronautics agencies while contributing to the
national space policy, was deleted from the National Aeronautics and Space Act along with its
functions after President Nixon abolished the council in an executive reorganization plan.
This body was later resurrected as the National Space Council in the 1989 NASA Authorization
Act. The council was used by President George H.W. Bush, but Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, 
and Barack Obama neither funded nor staffed the National Space Council.
In 1984 Earth science was formally added as one of NASA’s objectives. In addition, the act was modiwed
to mandate that NASA “seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial use of space.”
In 1990, NASA support of the commercial use of space was strengthened by the addition of requirements that 
NASA “encourage and provide for Federal Government use of commercially provided space services and hardware, 
consistent with the requirements of the Federal Government.</p>
