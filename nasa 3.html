     <h1>NASA’s primery program area</h1> 
<p>Currently, NASA is developing a Space Launch System program, the goal of which is to create a heavy-launch 
vehicle capable of transporting humans and cargo, including the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew 
Vehicle, beyond LEO. The wrst SLS, slated for 2017 launch, will carry
a prototype Orion capsule without a crew.4 These two projects account for about 80 percent 
of the exploration budget. The balance of the budget supports commercial spacexight activities
and research and development of various exploration systems.

<p>Space operations remains a separate line item, at least for now. It pays for the cost of operating and
maintaining the ISS as well as communications, launch services, and a few other items in the Spac
e Flight and Support line. It includes closing out the Space Shuttle Program.</p> 
<p>NASA has recently
merged the two organizations at NASA Headquarters that managed these programs to form the Human
Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. Most NASA centers receive funding from HEOMD to s
ome degree; the leaders include Johnson Space Center, Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center,
Glenn Research Center, and Langley Research Center. Human exploration and space operations together account
for almost half of NASA’s FY2012 budget.5 NASA also performs life and microgravity science research funded
by HEOMD. This research, among other things, is intended to determine how the human body adapts to 
long-duration spacexight and how to mitigate the negative effects of microgravity and other issues.</p>
